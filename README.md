# License-Plate-Detection

- **Objective**: Developed a machine learning model leveraging the Template Matching technique combined with Optical Character Recognition (OCR) to accurately detect vehicle license plates.

- **Machine Learning Model**: Implemented a robust model for license plate detection that utilizes pre-processed image data and the Template Matching method, allowing the system to efficiently identify plate patterns from various angles and lighting conditions.

- **Template Matching Technique**: Applied the Template Matching algorithm to search for predefined license plate templates within vehicle images. This approach ensures high accuracy in detecting and matching license plates, even when the vehicle is partially occluded or the plate is distorted.

- **Optical Character Recognition (OCR)**: Integrated an OCR component to extract alphanumeric characters from the detected license plate regions, facilitating the conversion of image data into machine-readable text.

- **Vehicle Plate Detection**: Designed the system to detect license plates from vehicle images in real-time, providing reliable performance under different environmental conditions, such as varying lighting, plate fonts, and image resolutions.

- **Performance**: Achieved high detection accuracy and low false positives by fine-tuning the OCR model and Template Matching parameters, ensuring the systemâ€™s robustness and scalability.

- **Applications**: Suitable for deployment in automated vehicle recognition systems, parking management, security surveillance, and law enforcement applications.
